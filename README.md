## Customizing Meteor

###How do I use a preview release of meteor?
Find the git tag you'd like to use in the [meteor repository's release list](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/releases), then use the --release flag with the meteor command. For example:
```bash
$ meteor --release template-engine-preview-10.1
```
Meteor will handle updating any smart packages and npm dependencies automatically.


###How do I use a unreleased branch of meteor?
You can git clone it anywhere on your system and then run it with:
```bash
$ path/to/checked/out/meteor/meteor
```
